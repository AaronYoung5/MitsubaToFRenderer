# Change MATLABDIR to the installed matlab directory (you can use which matlab to know the matlab path, which probably will be of the format <MATLABDIR>/ bin/matlab)

exr2avi(filename, options) from matlab command window 

#The procedure is faster if you are going to postprocess the transients in MATLAB but some users found it hard to compile mex files. I wrote a python script to convert exr files to mat files (exrread.py). However, this conversion is slow. If you are going to postprocess transients in python, this won't be a problem though. You can edit exrread python script according to your requirements. 

#For converting exr to mat files using python script, 
python exr2mat.py inFileName.exr outFileName
#which will create a outFileName.mat file. 
#This outFileName contains a variable "I" that can be viewed or saved with displayAndSaveVideo function file in matlab. Syntax: displayAndSaveVideo(I, options)
